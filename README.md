Pipeline Stages
1. Data Ingestion
The data ingestion component is built using the Factory pattern, allowing for easy integration of multiple data sources. The pipeline automatically fetches, validates, and prepares the housing data for further processing.

python
# Example of Factory Pattern for data sources
class DataSourceFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def get_data_source(source_type):
        if source_type == "csv":
            return CSVDataSource()
        elif source_type == "database":
            return DatabaseDataSource()
        # Additional data sources can be added here
2. Data Analysis & Preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis is performed to understand the key factors influencing house prices. The preprocessing steps handle missing values, outliers, and prepare the data for feature engineering.

Missing Values Analysis
SalePrice Distribution
Quality vs SalePrice Relationship
Correlation Analysis
Feature Relationships
3. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is implemented using the Strategy pattern, allowing for flexible application of different transformation techniques based on feature characteristics.

python
# Example of Strategy Pattern for feature transformations
class FeatureTransformationStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def transform(self, data):
        pass

class LogTransformation(FeatureTransformationStrategy):
    def transform(self, data):
        return np.log1p(data)

class OneHotEncodingTransformation(FeatureTransformationStrategy):
    def transform(self, data):
        return pd.get_dummies(data)
4. Model Building
The Template pattern is used for model building, ensuring consistent experiment structure while allowing flexibility in algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning.

python
# Example of Template Pattern for model training
class ModelTrainer(ABC):
    def train_model(self, X_train, y_train):
        self.preprocess_data(X_train, y_train)
        model = self.create_model()
        self.fit_model(model, X_train, y_train)
        return model
        
    @abstractmethod
    def preprocess_data(self, X, y):
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def create_model(self):
        pass
        
    def fit_model(self, model, X, y):
        model.fit(X, y)
5. Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using various metrics including RMSE, MAE, and R². MLflow is used to track all experiments, making it easy to compare different approaches and select the best model.

6. Deployment
The final model is deployed as a service using ZenML, with monitoring for performance and data drift. CI/CD pipelines ensure automated updates as new data becomes available.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Docker
Git
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HomePricePredict-E2E.git
cd HomePricePredict-E2E
Set up a virtual environment:
bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up ZenML:
bash
zenml init
zenml stack register default \
    --orchestrator local \
    --experiment_tracker mlflow \
    --model_deployer kubernetes
Running the Pipeline
bash
python src/main.py --config config/default.yaml
Model Serving
Once deployed, the model can be queried through the API:

python
import requests

data = {
    "features": {
        "LotArea": 8450,
        "YearBuilt": 2003,
        "BedroomAbvGr": 3,
        # ... other features
    }
}

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/predict", json=data)
print(f"Predicted house price: ${response.json()['prediction']:.2f}")
